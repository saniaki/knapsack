# knapsack
Two different implementations of knapsack algorithm is available here:
* straight forward implementation (slow for big inputs)
* recursive implementation (fast for big inputs): solving subproblems in a top-down recursive approach and also using hash table data structure to avoid unnecessary repetitive recursive calls (to save time)
  
The input files a knapsack instance with the following format:  
[knapsack_size][number_of_items]
[value_1] [weight_1]
[value_2] [weight_2]

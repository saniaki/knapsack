# knapsack
To different implementation of knapsack algorithm is available here:
* stright forward implementation (slow for big inputs)
* recursive implementation (fast for big inputs): solving subproblems in a top-down recurive approach and also using hash table data structure to avoid unnessary repitative recursive calls (to save time)


The input files a knapsack instance with the following format:
[knapsack_size][number_of_items]
[value_1] [weight_1]
[value_2] [weight_2]
...
